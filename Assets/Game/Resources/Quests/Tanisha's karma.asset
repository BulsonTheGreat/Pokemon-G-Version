    - I'm so tired of that b*tch Tanisha.
    - Always talking sh*t about me to our coworkers.
    - And spreading all them lies.
    - For real, keep it cute or keep that sh*t on mute.
    - Or she's gonna get fought next time I see her.
    - Well sadly, I need this job to pay my rent so I can't do it myself.
    - But you can do it for me, right handsome?
    - Don't forget to snatch her weave for me, I'll give you something nice in return
      if you do.
