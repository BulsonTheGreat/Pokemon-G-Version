          - Hello sleeping beauty, you finally woke up from your coma.
          - Normally this is the part where I ask you about your name, gender etc.
          - But we don't have much so I need to keep it as brief as possible.
          - Therefore your name is Doofus and you're a boy.
          - And if you don't like it you can go cancel the game devs on twitter.
          - Anyway, welcome to the world of pokemon, where you roam around the map
            catching some little sh*tters.
          - Beating other people with them until you eventually beat the champion
            and become the head of the government.
          - However you've already done all of that, it's just that our former leader,
            the "great" Jaynus MyGuy couldn't take his defeat.
          - Therefore he planted a bomb on your private jet with the help of your
            mother.
          - You're lucky I found you alive and brought you here.
          - Thankfully Jaynus wasn't able to recreate his regime yet.
          - So now all of his minions are stationed in that big a*s tower in the
            northern part of the city.
          - All you have to do is go there, beat all of them and remind them why
            you're the boss around here.
          - And if you need to heal your pokemon then try talking to a nurse/doctor.
          - Some will try to challenge you for a battle, but others will heal your
            units for free.
          - Or you can always go back and talk to my sexy assistant over there.
          - I should propably mention that your mother is also there.
          - Apparently she is salty that she got pregneant with you and couln't start
            her acting career.
          - That's why she helped Jaynus sabotage you and became his new trophy wife.
          - Alright then, since you've already cought all the usefull pokemon in
            our region you can grab them from that PC over there.
          - However the latest windows update crashed it so now it only gives random
            pokemon.
          - But you can always reroll them if you want, you've got like 150 to choose
            from.
          - As far as gameplay goes just remember to choose the right move based
            on your opponent's type.
          - And remember that when a pokemon uses a move corresponding to it's type
            then that move gains more power.

          - You're a world champion afterall.

          - Then google it on your phone or something, I'm not gonna bother explaining
            everything from scratch
          - You're a world champion afterall.

          - Just so you know the devs just dropped a new balance patch.
          - The type chart got slightly altered, some move got changed and some pokemon
            had their type changed aswell.
          - You can find more about it in that lovely note in the gamefiles.
          - Alright, I think that covers everything you need to know.
          - Now excuse me, I need to go smoke my new joint.
